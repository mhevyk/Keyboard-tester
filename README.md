# Keyboard-tester
<p>Small app that allows you to test the performance of your keyboard.</p>

<p>In this project was my first use of new technology: SCSS and preprocessor Prepros</p>

<p>When you click keys on keyboard, they highlight with colors on screen keyboard. If you click once, key becomes active, if you click again, key becomes unactive.</p>
